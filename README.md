## Requirements

* Locate command installed. If you do not have it installed, you can install it via `sudo apt install -y mlocate`

## FYI

* This extension was developed for personal usage and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Chrome browser. I've also added the 'Chromium' and 'Brave' browser to the bookmark search list but unfortunately, I don't have time to support and test all browsers and Linux distribution variations so you might face bugs. If you have an issue in your chromium based browser/Linux combination feel free to investigate and come up with the patch and please create issues only related to the Ubuntu and Chrome browser combination.
